<h1> Opportunity Cost </h1>

<p> Opportunity Cost is the cost when a decision is made. For example, when a person has a test tomorrow but is sleeping, the opportunity cost is studying for the test. The person decided to sleep, but the next best alternative decision is to study (making it the opportunity cost). </p>

<h2> Math to Show Opportunity Cost </h2>
<p> If your tuition is $2000 and books cost $400 for college, and you work 10 rather than 40 hours per week for 15 weeks and made $12 per  hour. Your room costs $4000, so what is the opportunity cost for attending college? </p>
<h3><a href="opportunitycostanswer.html">Opportunity Cost Math Problem Answer</a></h3>

<h4> Productive v. Allocative Efficiency </h4>
<p> Productive Efficiency on the graph is when the point is on the line. Allocative efficiency cannot be determined on the graph because different societies have different wants. You would need information in order to determin allocative efficiency. </p>

<h5> What is the Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost? </h5>
<p> This law states that the graph bows out because resources may not be able to be used for alternative goods so the output is less. For example, cactus and pineapples need different climates and soil to grow. So, when you want to grow more pineapples, you have to give up land in the desert to get more land in tropical areas. Having to pay for the tropical land means you have less money to use for output, or to grow more pineapples. So for every extra unit of pineapple, the opportunity cost increases. (Reference the image at the bottom of the page) </p>

 <h6> What is Constant Opportunity Cost? </h6>
  <p> This means that resources are able to be used for alternative goods so the opportunity cost stays consistent. For example, corn and wheat both need the same soil and climate to grow. So, when you make more corn than wheat, the opportunity cost will be the same per unit more corn grown. (Reference the image below.) </p>

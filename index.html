<h2> The Purpose of this website </h2>
<p>
Welcome to AP Macroeconomics! This AP course deals with important concepts regarding national economies and how a global market economy is created. As you will see, the information reads like summarized notes; although there is not much explanation, it is a good source to review for the AP exam in May. In addition, there will be many components on this website that I recommend you memorize because all of the information is interconnected. I wish you good luck exploring this website and wish you the best on getting college credit for this course!

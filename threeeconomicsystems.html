    <h2> Free Market </h2>
    <p> A free market is a system where the prices for goods and services are determined by the open market and consumers. There are five main characteristics to indicate if a country's economy is a free market economy. </p> 
        <ol>
            <li> little government involvement in the economy </li>
            <li> individuals own the resources and answer the economic questions themselves </li>
            <li> there is a chance to make a profit which gives an incentive to work </li>
            <li> there is a wide variety of goods produced </li>
            <li> competition and self interest work together to regulate the economy </li>
    </ol>
     <p> Countries with a free market, property rights, and rule of law tend to see more economic growth because they are more productive. </p>
     
            <h3> Invisible Hand </h3>
            <center><img src="invisiblehand.jpg" alt="adam smith's invisible hand" style="width:400px; height:300px;"></center>
     <p> The invisible hand is a concept that society's goals will be met as individuals seek their own self interest. It also indicates the indirect and unintended benefits from a free market economy. </p>
            
            
     <p> Make no mistake, we, the United States, are NOT a free market economy because the government plays a major role in our economy. Because the government plays a role in the economy, we are a Mixed Market Economy. </p>  
            
            <h3> Free Enterprise Economy </h3>
            <p> A free enterprise economy a type of economy where it can regulate itself in a freely competitive market through the supply and demand and minimal governmental intervention and regulation. There are four characteristics of a free enterprise economy. </p> 
            <ol>
                <li> Economic freedom: you can choose your job, when to work, and where to work </li>
                <li> Voluntary exchange: people and firms want to do business with each other, which makes each party better off. </li>
                <li> Private property and contracts: people can do what they want with their property which motivates them to work hard to get ahead in life. </li>
                <li> Profit motive: free to risk what we own to make more money, this makes people entrepreneurs </li>
            </ol>

  <h1> Three Economic Systems </h1>
  <p> Economic Systems are a way used by society to produce and distribute goods and services. They exist because survival depends on the ability to provide basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter, which economic systems decide. The type of economic system is determined by how a country answers three questions: what goods and services will be produced, how will the goods and services be produced, and who will consume the goods and services produced. Currrently, there are three types of economic systems which are a traditional economy, command economy, and market economy. There is no perfect type of economy because each one has its strengths and weaknesses, it is up to the people to decide what factors are expendable and what factors are nonnegotiable to the economy. </p>

    <h2> Free Market </h2>
    <p> A free market is a system where the prices for goods and services are determined by the open market and consumers. There are five main characteristics to indicate if a country's economy is a free market economy. </p> 
        <ol>
            <li> little government involvement in the economy </li>
            <li> individuals own the resources and answer the economic questions themselves </li>
            <li> there is a chance to make a profit which gives an incentive to work </li>
            <li> there is a wide variety of goods produced </li>
            <li> competition and self interest work together to regulate the economy </li>
     <p> Countries with a free market, property rights, and rule of law tend to see more economic growth because they are more productive. </p>
     
            <h3> Invisible Hand </h3>
            <center><img src="invisiblehand.jpg" alt="adam smith's invisible hand" style="width:400px; height:300px;"></center>
     <p> The invisible hand is a concept that society's goals will be met as individuals seek their own self interest. It also indicates the indirect and unintended benefits from a free market economy. </p>
            
            
     <p> Make no mistake, we, the United States, are NOT a free market economy because the government plays a major role in our economy. Because the government plays a role in the economy, we are a Mixed Market Economy. </p>  
            
            <h3> Free Enterprise Economy </h3>
            <p> A free enterprise economy a type of economy where it can regulate itself in a freely competitive market through the supply and demand and minimal governmental intervention and regulation. There are four characteristics of a free enterprise economy. </p> 
            <ol>
                <li> Economic freedom: you can choose your job, when to work, and where to work </li>
                <li> Voluntary exchange: people and firms want to do business with each other, which makes each party better off. </li>
                <li> Private property and contracts: people can do what they want with their property which motivates them to work hard to get ahead in life. </li>
                <li> Profit motive: free to risk what we own to make more money, this makes people entrepreneurs </li>
            </ol>

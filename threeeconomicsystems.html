  <h1> Three Economic Systems </h1>
  <p> Economic Systems are a way used by society to produce and distribute goods and services. They exist because survival depends on the ability to provide basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter, which economic systems decide. The type of economic system is determined by how a country answers three questions: what goods and services will be produced, how will the goods and services be produced, and who will consume the goods and services produced. Currrently, there are three types of economic systems which are a traditional economy, command economy, and market economy. There is no perfect type of economy because each one has its strengths and weaknesses, it is up to the people to decide what factors are expendable and what factors are nonnegotiable to the economy. </p>
